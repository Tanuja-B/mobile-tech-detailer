                <p id="cam">The camera system is outfitted with a laser transmitter and receiver.
                    The phone uses the time taken for the laser to bounce off its subject to determine the distance to the target. Good for taking 
                   photos quickly and in low light but less useful for landscape photos where the subject is far away
                    from the camera.</p>
